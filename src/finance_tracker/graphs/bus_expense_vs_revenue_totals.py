    This function filters the provided DataFrame to include only business-related entries,
    then gets the rows corresponding to "Revenue", "Expense", and "Transfer to Savings" cash flow
    types. It then creates a bar chart showing the monthly totals for each category, where
    "Transfer to Savings" is visualized as an "Expense". An annotation displaying the total
    'Profit' amount (after transferring to savings) is added to the chart. The chart can
    either be displayed interactively or saved as an HTML file.

            ['date', 'business_related', 'cash_flow_type', 'amount', 'name']
